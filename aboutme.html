  <h2>Bipartite Graph Check</h2>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/">A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
